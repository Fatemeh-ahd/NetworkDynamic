## Introduction
This project focuses on the study of Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) and their applications in modeling dynamic systems. CTMCs are essential for understanding the behavior of systems evolving over continuous time in a probabilistic manner. The project comprises two main parts: Single Particle Analysis and Dual Perspective Analysis.

## Project Overview
- **Part 1: Single Particle Analysis**
  - In this section, I analyze the behavior of a single particle performing a continuous-time random walk within a network.
  - I investigate:
    - Average time it takes a particle starting at node `ùëé` to leave the node and return to node `i`.
    - Comparison of experimental results to theoretical return times.
    - Computation of the variance of the consensus value.

- **Part 2: Dual Perspective Analysis**
  - This section provides a deeper understanding of CTMCs by examining them from two perspectives: Particle Perspective and Node Perspective.
  - I analyze:
    - How individual particles move within the network.
    - How nodes in the network influence particle transitions and dynamics.
