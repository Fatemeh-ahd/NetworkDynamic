## Introduction
Welcome to the Network Dynamic Repository! This repository hosts three distinct projects, each focusing on different aspects of dynamic networks. Below, you'll find an overview of each project along with the libraries used.

## Projects

### 1. Graph Theory
- **Description:** This project delves into the fascinating world of graph theory, exploring various concepts, algorithms, and applications within network analysis.
- **README:** [Link to Graph Theory Project README](Graph-Theory/README.md)

### 2. Random Walk
- **Description:** The Random Walk project is dedicated to understanding and modeling random walks within networks. It examines how particles move randomly through a network and the implications of such behavior.
- **README:** [Link to Random Walk Project README](Random-Walk/README.md)

### 3. Pandemic Simulation and Coloring Theory
- **Description:** This project is focused on pandemic modeling and control theory within dynamic networks. It aims to provide insights into the spread of diseases and strategies for containment.
- **README:** [Link to Pandemic Simulation Project README](Pandemic-Simulation/README.md)

## Libraries Used
The projects within this repository utilize various libraries and tools to facilitate network analysis, simulation, and modeling. The specific libraries used in 
each project are detailed in their respective READMEs.

## Key Words
Graph theory, Continuous Time Markov Chains, Poisson clocks, epidemic simulations on known graphs, pandemic scenarios with and without vaccination, real-world case studies like the H1N1 pandemic in Sweden 2009, and coloring

Feel free to explore each project by following the provided links to the individual project READMEs. If you have any questions, feedback, or would like to contribute, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

Happy exploring and learning about dynamic networks!
